<h1>Investment Reports Extension: Help/Notes:</h1>
<p>The Investment Reports Extension (invextension.mxt) is a set
of four useful investment reports which are displayed in table form or
downloaded in .csv form to a directory of the user's choosing. Reports
are detailed below, and a basic overview of classes is provided.
Reference website
is:&nbsp;http://code.google.com/p/moneydance-investment-reports/.&nbsp;Email
for more info is: dkfurrow@gmail.com.</p>
<h2>Main Report Tab&#8212;Report Options:</h2>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li class="normal">
<p>Report Options:</p>
</li>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li class="normal">
<p>Aggregation Options: Specifies how securities in
different accounts will be summarized: choices are:</p>
</li>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li class="normal">
<p>By Investment Account, Then By Tradeable
Securities/Account Cash&lt;/i&gt;: Aggregates by Investment
Account, and then, within each investment account, breaks out
performance data for all tradeable investments (e.g.
Stocks/Bonds/Mutual Funds) and uninvested cash.</p>
</li>
<li class="normal">
<p>By Ticker: Aggregates by Security (regardless of which
investment account). For example, if IBM is held in a taxable
investment account and 401K, the aggregate will show total performance
for IBM for both accounts.</p>
</li>
<li class="normal">
<p>By Security Type, Then By Security Sub Type: By
Security Type, and then (within each Security Type), by Security Sub
Type [as defined below]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<li class="normal">
<p>Show Aggregates for Single Security: If enabled, prints
composite report lines even if the composite consists of one security
(e.g. if IBM is held in only one investment account, the report will
include 2 lines for IBM, as a single security and as an aggregate).
Uncheck to suppress printing of single-security composites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="normal">Cost Basis Reporting Options:
Determines whether security
basis always defaults to average cost, or uses lot matching (on
accounts where the user has enabled it). Please note that Moneydance
currently only offers lot matching on long positions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="normal">Hide Positions with Zero value:
Controls whether closed
positions are shown in report output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="normal">Use Ordinary Return Calculation:
Check to use Ordinary
(i.e. non-time-weighted) total returns. Otherwise, use Modified-Dietz
Returns (see below for detail).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="normal">Display Number Of Frozen Columns:
The report output
consists of a table with fixed (i.e. non-scrollable) columns on the
left side. Choose how many columns are fixed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<li>
<p class="normal">Download Location: Sets the download
location for the
Transaction Activity and Security Prices downloads. Note: if report
generation generates any errors, the log file will also be in the
download location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="normal">Date Range: A Date Range consists of
<em>either</em></p>
</li>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>
<p class="normal">a Rule Input (i.e. sets a
reference date and a date rule
[e.g."quarter-to-date"]) <em>or</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="normal">Direct Input: A set of fixed dates
(from/to dates in the
case of the 'From/To' Report, snapshot case in the case of the Snapshot
Report.<br>
Note that the Date Range panel tests whether it has a valid date range,
and indicates to that effect in the panel border (red/invalid, green
valid).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<li>
<p class="normal">Reports to Run: Selects which
reports to run (note, at
least one report is automatically selected, and only one report type
may be run at a time).</p>
</li>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>
<p class="normal">'From-To' Reports describe
investment performance over a
prescribed period of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="normal">Snapshot Reports describe
investment performance on a
specific date</p>
</li>
</ol>
<li>
<p class="normal">Export Transaction/Price Data</p>
</li>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>
<p class="normal">Transaction Activity and
Securities Prices are downloaded
reports which contain all investment and pricing activity, respectively.</p>

and removing of custom
reports here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="normal">Generate Report</p>
</li>
<ol start="1" type="a">

<p class="normal"><strong>Run Reports</strong>
runs selected
reports as outlined in (6).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="normal"><strong>Show Help File </strong>displays
this file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="normal">The text panel displays report
status, and error messages
if any.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<h2>Report Fields Tab:</h2>
<p class="indented">Field Chooser Tab: allows the user to
choose which of the
available fields (i.e. columns) will be shown in report output, and the
order of viewed fields. The default configuration is that all fields
are displayed in standard order.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
</ol>
<h2>Accounts Tab:</h2>
<p class="indented">Account Chooser Tab: allows the user
to choose which of the
accounts will be included in reports <em>and</em>
downloads. The default is, all accounts included.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
</ol>
<h2>Investment Income/ Investment Expenses Tabs:</h2>
<p class="indented">Allows the user to designate specific
income or expense
categories which apply to investments. If a category (e.g. a check
written to "Tuition Expense") is not designated, then the income or
expense item will be treated as a transfer for the proposes of
calculated investment performance.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
</ol>
<h2>Reports:</h2>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Definitions:</p>
<p class="indented">Each report line item represents either a <span style="font-style: italic;">Security</span> or a
<span style="font-style: italic;">Composite</span>.
A <span style="font-style: italic;">Security</span>
represents a unique accounting unit in
Moneydance. For example, if IBM is held in two different investment
accounts, then each holding represents a unique Security. A composite
is a grouping of securities based on common characteristics. For
example, the user can choose to aggregate <em>By Ticker</em>,
and that option will form composites of all securities with a common
ticker (i.e. CurrencyType in the language of the Moneydance API). For
the example just cited, the Composite will consist of both IBM
holdings, presumably held in different investment accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Color Coding/Hide Closed Positions:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class="normal indented">Both From/To Report and Portfolio snapshot report use color coding to
represent Composite. Light Gray represents secondary Composites, Dark
Gray represents primary Composites, and Green represents All
Securities. Secondary Composites combine to produce Primary Composites,
and Primary Composites combine to produce the ALL Securities line.
Double-clicking a security in any report allows the user to edit
security properties.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>
<p class="normal">"From/To" Report (FromDate, ToDate)</p>
</li>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li>
<p class="normal">InvAcct: Investment Account: The
investment account in
which securities and cash are held.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="normal">Security: Either a designated
security, or one of 3
aggregated values:</p>
</li>
<ol start="1" type="i">
<li>
<p class="normal">Securities-ALL represents
aggregated securities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="normal">Securities/CASH-ALL represents
aggregated securities

</li>
<li>
<p class="normal">CASH represents uninvested cash</p>
</li>
</ol>
<li>
<p class="normal">SecType: User defined Security
Type as recorded in
Moneydance. Please Note: Security Type and SubType are managed in
Moneydance at the account level: thus it is entirely possible to
characterize the same traded security differently in two accounts. For
example, IBM can be listed as a "Bond", "Municipal" in one account and
a "Stock", "Large-Cap" in another. This report is not designed to check
for such potential discrepancies.</p>

<li><p class="normal">Annualized Percent Return:</p></li>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li><p class="normal">APR is calculated using the net cash effect (less
transfer) or each transaction associated with a security (securities),
plus the start value and end value associated with the Start and End
date as noted below.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">Start Date is the later of (a) report start date (b) the
date on which the first buy or short sale occurs. End Date is the
earlier of (a) report end date and (b) the date on which a security
position is closed. Therefore, changing report start and end dates has
no effect on the returns calculation for a position which is closed at
start or end date, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">This calculation method can be replicated by the XIRR
function of Microsoft Excel.</p></li>
</ol>
<li><p class="normal">Transaction Entry:</p></li>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li><p class="normal">Any expense associated with a buy/sell/short cover/cover
short transaction is considered to be a commission.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">All designated income and expense associated with an
investment account is considered as income (or expense) associated with
Cash (see above for details).</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">All Transfer (i.e. "BuyTransfer" and "SellTransfer")
transactions in the table above are considered to be&nbsp;transfers
of cash to non-investment accounts. If the user wants to transfer cash
between two invesment accounts, then&nbsp;enter two transactions: a
"buy" and "transfer" or "sell" and "transfer"to effect the desired
result.</p></li>
</ol>
<li><p class="normal">Dividend Frequency/ Dividend Calculations:</p></li>
<ol start="1" type="a">
<li><p class="normal">Dividend Frequency (which affects annualized dividend,
dividend yield calculations) is estimated through a heuristic. Multiple
dividends which occur within 21 days of each other (such cases as
separate dividend/capital gains transactions, or dividend corrections)
are ignored. The heuristic currently assigns one frequency to each
security, based on the time between dividends of the last two dividend
instances. If only one dividend is found, the dividend frequency is
assumed to be annual.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">Annualized Dividend: The report first calculates the
total of the most current dividend (which might consist of multiple
transactions within an assumed 21 day window, as noted previously).
Next an annualized Dividend/Share value is calculated, using the
position prior to the most recent set of dividend transactions (this
covers the case of mutual fund dividend/reinvest transactions, where
buys are recorded coincident with dividends). Finally, the
Dividend/Share value is multiplied by the current position, in order to
get the final value for Annualized Dividend.</p></li>
</ol>
<li><p class="normal">Editing Security Information: Double-clicking a security
row will bring up a dialogue box allowing the user to edit security
properties (e.g. Security Type, Secruity Sub Type).</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">Returns backup: Doubleclicking a return cell will bring up
a text box containing the information which backs up the return
calculation, allowing the user to replicate the return calculation in a
spreadsheet if desired.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes on Classes:</h2>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li><p class="normal">The Main class registers the extension and passes
Moneydance data to other classes.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">The&nbsp;ReportControlFrame class receives the output
of Main, creates a frame to hold the report controller GUI.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">The&nbsp;ReportControlPanel class controls report
output: the user selects report parameters, executes reports via the
Run Reports button.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">The&nbsp;BulkSecInfo class contains mapping of
investment accounts to security accounts, security accounts to
transactions, and contains&nbsp;AccountWrapper classes which hold
transaction-level and security-level data. BulkSecInfo also produces
the Securities Prices Report and Transaction Activity Report from these
transaction and pricing data.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">TransactionValues returns one line of data for each parent
transaction with buy, sell, short sell, cover short, commission,
transfer, and security quantity data. <br>TransactionValues also create synthetic cash account to record movement
of uninvested cash for each Investment Account. The initial account
balance is recorded as a purchase of cash, and new TransactionValues
objects are created for each related Security Transaction or Investment
Account transaction. For example, a purchase of a security and the
payment of the related commission creates a sale of the appropriate
amount of cash (potentially a short-sale if the account does not
contain enough cash). All synthetically created TransactionValues
object have a transaction id of x.1, where x is the transaction number
of the primary transaction which created the cash transaction. For
example if a security purchase has id 121, then the corresponding cash
sale has id 121.1. <br>TransactionValues includes a GainsCalc object (current concrete
implementations GainsAverageCalc and GainsLotMatchCalc), which
calculates long and short basis for a security.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">All Extractor classes serve to extract value from a series
of security transactions.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">The TotalReport Class is an abstract class holding HashSets
of SecurityReport and CompositeReport objects. Its concrete
implementations are the TotalFromToReport and TotalSnapShotReport.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">ComponentReport is an abstract class which is a superclass
to both SecurityReport and CompositeReport.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">SecurityReport Class is an abstract class representing one
report line of either the From/To or Snapshort report. Therefore, its
concrete implementations are SecurityFromToReport and
SecuritySnapshotReport. Note that a SecurityReport can either represent
a report line for a leaf-level security or the aggregation line for a
CompositeReport (described below).</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">CompositeReport class performs aggregation of one or more
leaf-level (i.e. unique security in unique investment account) security
reports. It holds one placeholder SecurityReport (used to store
aggregate data) and contains references to all leaf-level
SecurityReports aggregated by the CompositeReport.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">Aggregator is an interface for the classes which are used
to aggregate leaf-level security Reports. To accomplish this,
Moneydance classes are wrapped in classes which implement Aggregator.
The wrapped classes are InvestmentAccountWrapper, CurrencyWrapper,
SecurityAccountWrapper, Tradeable, SecurityTypeWrapper, and
SecuritySubTypeWrapper. In this case Tradeable is defined by a single
Boolean member false for the CurrencyType used to define uninvested
cash, true for all other securities.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">The&nbsp;DateUtils and&nbsp;IOUtils classes provide
useful methods for date math and input/output, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">The DateRange and DateRangePanel classes serve to control
the DateRange object wihich governs the time frame of report output.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">The&nbsp;GoalSeek,&nbsp;GoalSeekData,&nbsp;GoalSeekFunction,&nbsp;XIRR,&nbsp;XIRRData,
and&nbsp;XIRRNPV classes are all used for calculation of Annualized
Percent Return. More info can be found at
http://gautam.satpathy.org/software/java/jxirr.</p></li><li>The "GainsCalc" classes control cost basis calcultions (average cost and lot matching).</li>
<li><p class="normal">The ReportSaveControlFrame, ReportSaveControlPanel,
controls the process of saving a report to a specific name.</p></li><li><p class="normal">All
classes named similarly to "ReportConfig" (e.g. ReportConfig,
ReportConfigChooserPanelBase, etc) are control mechanisms for a unique
report configuration. &nbsp;The complete list of elements for a report configuration are in the ReportConfig class.</p></li><li>MDData is a singleton class which stores Moneydance file data.</li>
<li><p class="normal">The SecurityAccountEditorForm controls the editing of
security properties. Double-clicking on the report display generates
this form to edit security properties.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">ReportOutputTable class implements and enhanced JTable for
use in report display. The display implements methods so that the
columns are sized based on cell data length, the user can fix columns
for ease of scrolling, closed positions can be either displayed or
hidden, and the user may implement a hierarchical sort of data (3
columns or less).</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">The Prefs class holds report preferences.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes on Test Classes:</h2>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li><p class="normal">The project supports JUnit testing. Test classes are under
the test folder.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">BulkSecInfoTest checks for consistency of transaction data
from the test database testMD02.md and stored data in csv format. Both
the average cost and lot-matching cost accounting methods are supported.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">The&nbsp;ReportProdTest class contains 3
tests:&nbsp;testGetFromToReport() and&nbsp;testGetSnapReport()
generate From/To and Snap reports, respectively, from the MD test
database testMD01.md included in the resources folder. The generated
reports are then compared to saved versions (in csv files) also
contained in the resources folder. Finally,
the&nbsp;testRepSnapAgainstFT&nbsp;generates a Snap Report and
compares the columns in that report to series of generated From/To
reports. This ensures that the Snap Report and FT Reports are producing
the same data. The class also contains tests which check for
consistency between aggregated returns and leaf-level security reports
for different aggregation methods.</p></li>
<li><p class="normal">The CheckRepFromTo and&nbsp;CheckRepSnap classes, also
in the test folder, are not actually JUnit tests. Instead, they output,
in tabbed-text form, and exploded view of the From/To and Snap reports,
respectively. This allows report output to be checked against
intermediate calculations. An example of how to do that is found in the
spreadsheet ReportCheckExample.xlsm&amp;, also found in the
resources directory. That spreadsheet also breaks down some sample
transactions in order to show Mark-to-Market T-account entries.</p></li>
